#  R-programming (i only have 10 days to learn it all) Day 2 today, could'nt make a Repo before, so here it goes....
Learn R with me :)
#  Introduction
R is a programming language for statistical analysis and visualization. Using R, you can take raw data and understand the trends and patterns in it. You can also use R to create customizable, professional-looking visualizations.This document embarks a journey of mine which anyone can be a part of by clicking the fork button.
